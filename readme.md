# Python bz2 Build

A project for building the `_bz2` Python package for:

 - OS X x64
 - Linux i686
 - Linux x86_64

and the following versions of Python:

 - 2.6
 - 3.3

To obtain the `.pyd` files for Windows, grab it from the
official releases.

Since Sublime Text 2 uses the system version of Python
2.6, there is no OS X 2.6 script.
